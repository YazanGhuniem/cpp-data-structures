# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms Library

A modular C++ library implementing classic data structures and algorithms, designed for learning and practice.


## Features

- Singly Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Tables (chaining and/or open addressing)
- Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- Heaps
- Graph algorithms
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set) with path compression


## Getting Started

To explore the data structures, simply browse the `/include` folder to review the header files and understand the implementation of each structure.
