# My Data Structures Library

A comprehensive C++ implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms, built from scratch for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Overview

This project implements the following data structures:
- **Linear Structures**: Singly/Doubly Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- **Hash Tables**: Separate Chaining and Open Addressing (Linear Probing)
- **Trees**: Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree (TODO), Min Heap
- **Graphs**: Adjacency List representation with DFS/BFS
- **Union-Find**: Disjoint Set with path compression and union by rank
